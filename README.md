Accounting Documents to Finance Department in Java


Thought for 5 seconds### Automated Transfer of Accounting Documents to Finance Department in Java

I'll create a Java application that automatically transfers accounting documents to the finance department. This solution will monitor a source directory, process documents, and move them to a destination directory on a schedule.

```typescriptreact project="document-transfer"
...
```

## How This Solution Works

This Java application automates the transfer of accounting documents to the finance department with the following features:

1. **Real-time File Monitoring**:

1. Watches the source directory for new accounting documents
2. Processes files as soon as they are created



2. **Scheduled Batch Processing**:

1. Runs a daily job at 2:00 AM to transfer any remaining documents
2. Ensures no documents are missed



3. **Document Processing**:

1. Validates documents before transfer
2. Adds timestamps to filenames to prevent conflicts
3. Copies documents to the finance department directory
4. Archives original documents



4. **Document Type Detection**:

1. Identifies document types based on filename patterns
2. Supports various document formats (PDF, Excel, Word, XML)



5. **Comprehensive Logging**:

1. Records all transfer activities
2. Logs document metadata
3. Maintains rolling log files





## How to Use

1. **Configure the directories** in `DocumentTransferApp.java`:

1. `SOURCE_DIR`: Where accounting documents are stored
2. `DESTINATION_DIR`: Where finance department accesses documents
3. `ARCHIVE_DIR`: Where processed documents are archived



2. **Build the application**:

```plaintext
mvn clean package
```


3. **Run the application**:

```plaintext
java -jar target/document-transfer-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```


4. **Monitor the logs** in the `logs` directory to track document transfers.


You can extend this solution by adding database integration to store document metadata or implementing email notifications for successful transfers.
